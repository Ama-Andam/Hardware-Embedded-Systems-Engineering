# Day 5/365 — Deep Dive into Synthesis

Today I watched a comprehensive tutorial on synthesis to understand how RTL code gets converted into optimized gate-level netlists. The video covered both logic synthesis and physical synthesis flows, which are critical steps in the chip design process.

## What I learned
- **Logic Synthesis** transforms RTL code into a gate-level netlist using standard cell libraries
- **Physical Synthesis** goes beyond logic synthesis by considering physical placement and routing during optimization
- **Synthesis Flow**: RTL → Elaboration → Generic Optimization → Technology Mapping → Optimization → Gate-Level Netlist
- **Genus Synthesis Flow** is commonly used in industry for advanced synthesis
- **Goals of Synthesis**: Area optimization, timing closure, power optimization, and design rule compliance
- **Physical Synthesis advantages**: Better timing accuracy, reduced design iterations, and improved QoR (Quality of Results)

## Key stages of Logic Synthesis
1. **Elaboration**: Converting RTL to generic logic gates
2. **Generic Optimization**: Technology-independent optimization
3. **Technology Mapping**: Mapping to target library cells
4. **Optimization**: Fine-tuning for area, timing, and power

## Inputs Required for Synthesis
- RTL code (Verilog/VHDL)
- Standard cell library
- Timing constraints (SDC files)
- Design constraints

## Tools Used in Industry
- Cadence Genus
- Synopsys Design Compiler
- Open-source: Yosys

## Reference
- Video I watched: [Comprehensive Synthesis Tutorial](https://youtu.be/_8CGpFcuidM?si=TYhZtzFJrJFC_0Ii)
- Topics covered: Introduction to Synthesis, Logic Synthesis Flow, Genus Synthesis Flow, Goals of Synthesis, Detailed stages, Physical Synthesis

## Takeaways / next steps
- This theoretical foundation complements the hands-on Yosys work from Day 4
- Understanding the difference between logic and physical synthesis helps explain tool trade-offs
- Next: Experiment with different synthesis constraints to see how they affect the output netlist
